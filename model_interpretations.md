## Simple Linear Regression Model Interpretation
Feature: `sqft_living`
- **Coefficient (`sqft_living`):** 279.55
  - Interpretation: For each additional square foot of living area, the predicted house price increases by approximately $279.55, holding all other factors constant (though none were included in this simple model).
- **Intercept:** -41999.19
  - Interpretation: The intercept represents the predicted price when the `sqft_living` is zero. In this context, a house with 0 sqft living area is unrealistic, so the intercept of $-41999.19 doesn't have a practical meaning other than adjusting the line's position.

## Multiple Linear Regression Model Interpretation
- **Coefficients:**
  - **`bedrooms`:** -32786.57
    - Interpretation: Holding all other features constant, each additional bedroom is associated with a decrease in predicted price by approximately $32786.57. This might seem counter-intuitive and could be due to multicollinearity or other factors in the model.
  - **`bathrooms`:** 46402.20
    - Interpretation: Holding all other features constant, each additional bathroom is associated with an increase in predicted price by approximately $46402.20.
  - **`sqft_living`:** 107.16
    - Interpretation: Holding all other features constant, each additional square foot of living area is associated with an increase in predicted price by approximately $107.16.
  - **`sqft_lot`:** 0.08
    - Interpretation: Holding all other features constant, each additional square foot of lot size is associated with a very small increase in predicted price by approximately $0.08.
  - **`floors`:** 1274.28
    - Interpretation: Holding all other features constant, each additional floor is associated with an increase in predicted price by approximately $1274.28.
  - **`waterfront`:** 568157.11
    - Interpretation: Holding all other features constant, having a waterfront view (value 1 vs 0) is associated with a significant increase in predicted price by approximately $568157.11.
  - **`view`:** 50490.82
    - Interpretation: Holding all other features constant, each unit increase in the view rating is associated with an increase in predicted price by approximately $50490.82.
  - **`condition`:** 28740.78
    - Interpretation: Holding all other features constant, each unit increase in the condition rating is associated with an increase in predicted price by approximately $28740.78.
  - **`grade`:** 95688.38
    - Interpretation: Holding all other features constant, each unit increase in the grade rating is associated with a significant increase in predicted price by approximately $95688.38.
  - **`sqft_above`:** 69.97
    - Interpretation: Holding all other features constant, each additional square foot above ground is associated with an increase in predicted price by approximately $69.97.
  - **`sqft_basement`:** 37.19
    - Interpretation: Holding all other features constant, each additional square foot of basement area is associated with an increase in predicted price by approximately $37.19.
  - **`yr_built`:** -2537.50
    - Interpretation: Holding all other features constant, each year newer the house was built is associated with a decrease in predicted price by approximately $2537.50. This could be counter-intuitive and might relate to other correlated features like location or renovation status.
  - **`yr_renovated`:** 21.95
    - Interpretation: Holding all other features constant, each year more recent the renovation (or if renovated vs not, depending on how 0 is coded) is associated with a small increase in predicted price by approximately $21.95.
  - **`lat`:** 556729.71
    - Interpretation: Holding all other features constant, each unit increase in latitude is associated with a large increase in predicted price by approximately $556729.71. Latitude likely captures geographic value differences.
  - **`long`:** -101852.45
    - Interpretation: Holding all other features constant, each unit increase in longitude (moving east) is associated with a decrease in predicted price by approximately $101852.45. Longitude also likely captures geographic value differences.
  - **`sqft_living15`:** 26.74
    - Interpretation: Holding all other features constant, each additional square foot of living area for the nearest 15 neighbors is associated with an increase in predicted price by approximately $26.74.
  - **`sqft_lot15`:** -0.33
    - Interpretation: Holding all other features constant, each additional square foot of lot size for the nearest 15 neighbors is associated with a small decrease in predicted price by approximately $0.33.

- **Intercept:** -34632133.33
  - Interpretation: The intercept represents the predicted price when all feature values are zero. Similar to the simple model, this value ($-34632133.33) often lacks practical meaning in real-world scenarios where features cannot realistically be zero simultaneously (e.g., 0 sqft, 0 bedrooms, built in year 0 at lat/long 0).
